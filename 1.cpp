What is STL in C++?
STL (Standard Template Library) is a collection of ready-made code in C++ that helps you work with data more easily. It provides tools like:

Containers – to store data (like arrays, lists, sets, maps)

Algorithms – to work with data (like sort, search, count)

Iterators – to move through the data (like a pointer)

Functions – to customize behavior
